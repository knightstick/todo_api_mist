# codespace_stuff

So I'm really into the idea of Codespaces and remote dev at the moment, but, also Gleam. I want to find the best way to start new projects in new languages, and am keen to keep trying different ways to get started - I should probably just build stuff, but, hey, this is fun not work hey...

[![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/todo_api_mist/)

```sh
gleam add todo_api_mist@1
```
```gleam
import todo_api_mist

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/todo_api_mist>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
